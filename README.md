# 5mins fitness app

We designed and developed an iOS fitness application with the ability to send daily context-aware notifications based on: (1) a userâ€™s location, (2) current activity level and (3) at a pre-defined time. The fitness app utilizes reminders with the purpose of motivating users to do their daily workouts.
This workout application is built for iOS devices and it is made to look and feel similar to two of the most downloaded fitness apps available in the App Store: 7 Minute Workout: Fitness App (8.4k download and 4.7 stars) and Workout for Women (31k downloads and 4.7 stars).
All of the workouts are inspired by DAREBEE workout routines, a free global fitness resource. You can read more about this application [here](https://dl.acm.org/doi/fullHtml/10.1145/3406324.3417145)

Here is a demo of the app:
